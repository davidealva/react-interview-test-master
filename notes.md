Put any notes for us here (If you feel you need to explain how / why you did something the way you did):

Step one, part one took 45 mins, mostly restructuring app, setting up structure for Redux to work and pull in data from api.. stopped work at 12:50, had to put out a fire (not litterally)

Completed step one, approx 50mins. Added Bulma for styling, mostly because I'm familiar with it
and can style quickly. Completed cards as required
