Put any notes for us here (If you feel you need to explain how / why you did something the way you did):

Step one, part one took 45 mins, mostly restructuring app, setting up structure for Redux to work and pull in data from api.. stopped work at 12:50, had to put out a fire (not litterally)

Completed step one, approx 50mins. Added Bulma for styling, mostly because I'm familiar with it
and can style quickly. Completed cards as required 

Tried to complete the remaining steps, I was able to structure the app for the remaing search bar item, pagination, and styling, but unfortunatly I have run out of 
time. Due to extrodanary circumstances this week I didn't want to hold up your ability to review what I have so far. 

Thank you.
